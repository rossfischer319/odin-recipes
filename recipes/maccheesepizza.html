        <img src="macpizza.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A cheese pizza with macaroni and extra cheese</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust</li>
            <li>¾ cup cavatappi (corkscrew macaroni)</li>
            <li>⅔ (16 ounce) jar cheese sauce (such as Ragu® Double Cheddar), divided, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place pizza crust on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatappi in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 11 minutes. Drain and return pasta to the pot.</li>
            <li>Stir 1/2 the cheese sauce and butter into the cavatappi pot over medium heat until butter is melted and pasta-cheese mixture is combined. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of cheese sauce over the pizza crust. Sprinkle shredded Cheddar cheese over the cheese sauce onto the crust. Pour pasta-cheese mixture over the Cheddar cheese, and top with another 1/2 the cheese sauce.</li>
            <li>Bake pizza in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes. Let rest for 2 minutes before slicing.</li>
